Dear trainers,

i want to say you, that my frontend is not so advanced i would like to be, i had some difficulties with 
the bootstrap and the connection  from bootstrap/HTML5/CSS with php;

I did just a small version from the database, i will send you next week my version of the libary.

Thank you 


Your Sincerely

Marko Stancevic
